=== Developer Comment (Leave this here, users don't see it) ===

In general, you can use the same markup as sites like Discord, Reddit, etc...

Some basics:
    *text* -> italic text
    **text** -> bold text
    
    + Item 1 -> Bullet
    + Item 2    Points

Most links should automatically turn blue (Make sure you have the http... or www... if they don't).
